Big Data Engineer
In my 5 years of experience as a Big Data Engineer, I have made significant contributions in the development, optimization, and management of data sets, data infrastructure, and machine learning models. Through initiatives such as enhancing cloud-based data warehouse security, introducing automated data validation processes, and developing high-performing ML models, I have been able to boost data integrity, reduce costs, and improve performance. Most notably, I have reduced the migration costs of large data sets and ML models for cloud-based architectures by 50% and 30%, respectively.
WORK EXPERIENCE
Big Data Engineer
